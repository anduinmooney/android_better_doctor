# _Android Application Development: Week 2_

#### _This is the foundation of an application that I'm currently working on._

#### By _**Anduin Mooney**_

## Description

_This is the start of a month long project. I'm unsure with what API I want to use, so I'm still researching. Currently, I'm using Spotify as a current filler for the title and theme of the application. To learn more about what I have planned for the future, please read below_

## App Specifications & Development Details

_This part of the README is desgined to help both the user and I to understand the kind of application I'm developing, the development process, and what still needs to be implemented (and how I will implement them) based on certain guidelines_

### Development Process

_This is a 4 week project that I will be working on throughout my final course in Epicodus. Certain critera needs to be met for each week, and this is to help both me and the user to understand what needs to be implemented and the future of the project. I still don't know exactly what I'm going to make, but I have a rough idea as of now of what it could be. In the second week, I will be implementing an API, which I feel like would be the backbone of this project, so I'm still doing research on the kind of API I want to use. As of right now, I'm looking at 3, and they are as follows._
* _[BetterDoctor](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/)_
* _[Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)_
* _[GiantBomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/)_

_Of course, I could think of more, but until the second week comes, I'm going to be building the foundation of this app (UI, UX, storing data & objects, navigation) which hopefully will give me the freedom to be able to use any of the API's I've been researching._

### Development Schedule

_As I mentioned above, this project is going to have a 4 week development cycle, which the outlines for each week will be listed below._

* _Week 1: UI, UX, storing inputs and navigation_
* _Week 2: Tracking and Collecting Objects from an API_
* _Week 3: Currenty unknown until I progress_
* _Week 4: Currenty unknown until I progress_

### Week 1 Specifications, Requirements, and Roadmap
_To help both the user and me understand what the development process looks like, I'm going to list the required specifications and how I will go about meeting them._

1. _Create an app with at least, bare minimum, 3 activities that the user can navigate to. Don't neglect about, bio, contact etc activities. Build these activities out with designs, UI, and functionality as much as possible. Remember to validate form inputs. Use toasts and hide/show to communicate statuses to your user, as well as DialogFragments._

* _Since I'm still researching several different API's, I'm going to develop the backbone of the application and develop features that all of these API's will need anyways. I'm going to create an about page that will list information about the application and the development process like you're seeing here, a contact page, some sort of grid list for storing API data, and a mock login function that will simulate logging in to the application (I say simulate since all this function is going to do right now is store & display the user's name)_

2. _Display a list of information. Build this out as much as possible._
* _As stated above, I'm going to create a grid list with mock data until I get the api set up. This gridlist will contain things such as a name/title, a short description, and a photo_

3. _Implement custom adapters (both Array and from scratch)_
* _I'm going to implement this with a gridview using mock data_
4. _Use custom typefaces to enhance your designs._
* _Basic UI additions, going to style each activity to give it a professional feel_
5. _Gather user input and pass it to another activity._
* _I'm going to add a form once the app is launched asking for the user's name, and I'm going to display it on the following page. Later, I will be able to add user authentication to increase the usabilty of this. I might add the ability to add to the mock-list, if I can figure that out._

## Installation
* _Clone repository from github_
* _Open repository file with Android Studio (3.0.1 is preferred, or else there may be errors)_
* _Create a virtual android device (Make sure it runs on marshmallow API23)_
* _Run the application!_
